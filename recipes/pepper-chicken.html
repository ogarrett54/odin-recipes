        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Main</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>800 g chicken thigh fillets, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>120 g corn flour (cornstarch)</li>
            <li>2 onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 red capsicum, deseeded and diced</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for shallow frying, plus 1 tbsp extra</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Black pepper sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp whole Sichuan peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 tbsp whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>144 g oyster sauce</li>
            <li>60 g Chinese Shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>10 g sweet dark soy sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Marinade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>30 g soy sauce</li>
            <li>10 g garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the chicken with the marinade ingredients. Set aside for later.</li>
            <li>Place the Sichuan peppercorns in a dry frying pan over high heat. Cook, shaking the pan, for 2 minutes or until the peppercorns are fragrant and just starting to smoke. Transfer to a mortar along with the black peppercorns. Grind to a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Mix 1 tbsp of the peppercorn powder with the oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine and sweet dark soy sauce. Keep the remaining peppercorn powder in an air-tight container and use to season anything from pan-fried chicken to grilled prawns.</li>
            <li>Add about a centimetre of oil to the base of a wok or frying pan over high heat. When the oil is hot, toss half the marinated chicken in the corn flour and cook in the oil for 3-4 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Drain on paper towel. Repeat with the remaining chicken and flour.</li>
            <li>Heat the 1 tablespoon of oil in a large wok or frying pan over high heat. Add the onion and capsicum and stir-fry for a minute. Add the chicken and the peppercorn sauce and stir-fry until well combined. Serve immediately.</li>
