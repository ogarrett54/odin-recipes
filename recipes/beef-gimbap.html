            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Gimbap (or kimbap) is a Korean seaweed rice roll, typically filled with seasoned rice, vegetables, and protein. Unlike sushi, gimbap rice is flavoured with sesame oil instead of vinegar, giving it a nutty, aromatic taste. It’s perfect for eating on the go—just slice and enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the Beef: </strong>In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and black pepper. Add the beef and toss well to coat. Allow it to marinate for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Rice: </strong>Cook the rice according to packet instructions. Once cooked, transfer to a bowl and mix with sesame oil, salt, and sesame seeds. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Omelette: </strong>Whisk the eggs in a large bowl with salt. Heat a non-stick pan over medium-low heat. Add 2 teaspoons of oil, then pour in the eggs. Allow to set for 4-5 minutes or until just golden underneath. Flip the omelette in the pan or, if you’re not feeling confident, place it under a grill until set. Transfer the omelette to a chopping board and let it cool before cutting it into 2cm strips.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Carrot & the Beef: </strong>Heat ½ tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok or frying pan over medium heat. Stir-fry the shredded carrot with sea salt for 2 minutes, then set aside. Using the same pan, add another 1 tablespoon of oil. When the oil is hot, add the marinated bulgogi beef and cook over medium-high heat until caramelised and cooked through. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Gimbap: </strong>Place a gimbap roller on a chopping board and lay a sheet of seaweed shiny side down. Spread a thin layer of rice evenly over the seaweed, leaving a 2cm border at the top edge. Arrange perilla leaves, lettuce, bulgogi beef, carrot, pickled radish, egg, and green chilli horizontally across the middle. Carefully roll from the bottom up, using the roller to keep it tight. Press firmly at the end to seal. Set the roll seam-side down and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li><strong>Slice and Serve: </strong>To slice cleanly, use a sharp knife and lightly oil the blade. Slice forward from tip to heel, then use a gentle sawing motion to finish the cut. Brush the gimbap with a little sesame oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with mayonnaise for dipping and enjoy!</li>
