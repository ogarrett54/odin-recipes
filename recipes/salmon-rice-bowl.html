    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Salmon: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 x 200g (7 oz) skin-on salmon fillets</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 small Asian shallots, sliced</li>
        <li>2 spring onions (scallions), trimmed, cut into batons</li>
        <li>2 cups (loosely packed) Asian herbs e.g. mint, coriander and/or spring onion (scallions)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Dressing: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 long red chilies, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>3 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>3 tbsp lime juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp shaved palm sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Dressing: </strong>Place the chilli, garlic, and a pinch of salt in a mortar. Use a pestle to pound to a rough paste. Transfer the paste to a small bowl, then add the fish sauce, lime juice, and palm sugar. Stir well to dissolve the sugar. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep the Salmon: </strong>Pat the salmon skin dry with paper towel, then sprinkle with salt. Heat a frying pan over high heat. When the pan is hot, add the oil. Place the salmon fillets skin-side down and cover with a sheet of baking paper. Weigh the fillets down by placing a small saucepan or pot on top of the baking paper. Cook for 2–3 minutes, then remove the top pan and baking paper. Flip the salmon and cook for another 3 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked to your liking. Transfer to a plate to rest, then break into rough chunk</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Bowl: </strong>Just before serving, add the shallots, herbs and dressing to the salmon. Gently toss, making sure not to break up the salmon too much. Enjo</li>
